# Why RMarkdown?

## Let's watch a small video

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JldKoA0zw)

## Any user here already?

If so, let's talk about your experience!

## Common workflow without RMarkdown

* Script producing results and figures

* Copy-paste into Word

* Back and forth

## RMarkdown

* Code chunks and text in the same file.

* Everything is then knitted into the final document!

## One tool, many possible outputs {data-background-iframe="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html"}

# How?

## Let's go!

* Create a new Rmd from RStudio

* Knit the template

* echo

## A bit of structure

* Headers

* Text style

* Itemize

## Pretty tables

`knitr::kable`

## Inline code

Chunks vs. inline code.

## Why it's better to name your chunks

* navigation

* de-bugging

## Regression results

* The power of `broom`

## Figure options 

Control the size

## Caching

When your calculations are quite slow.

# If we've got time

## reveal.js

We could try creating slides like these ones!

# And after this small tutorial
