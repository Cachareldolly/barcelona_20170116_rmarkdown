RMarkdown tutorial
==================

This repository contains the material for the R-Ladies Barcelona introduction tutorial about RMarkdown.

The slides .Rmd is [here](rmd_tutorial.Rmd), the html rendered version is [here](rmd_tutorial.html). The slides are also alvailable via [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/masalmon/rladiesbcn_rmarkdown). Most of the tutorial will be live coding though so the slides are not too useful on their own.

We will learn RMarkdown by creating a report together where we'll test some options and possibilities, like the report [here](report_example/test_report.Rmd).

If we have time we will look at another output format based on the same principles, see the slides [here](slides_example/test_slides.Rmd).
